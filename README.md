# Terraform - Advanced Features and Best Practices

This repository contains a Terraform project where I am experimenting with advanced features, best practices, and
setting up a GitHub CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The goal is to create an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution
that adheres to the latest standards in Terraform and integrates seamlessly with CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage infrastructure with Terraform, showcasing the following:

- Usage of advanced Terraform features (modules, workspaces, remote backends, etc.)
- Terraform best practices (code structure, variable usage, state management)
- Automated deployment using GitHub Actions
- Versioning and code review workflows

## Features

- **Terraform Modules**: Encapsulation of reusable code with Terraform modules.
- **Remote Backend**: Storing Terraform state in a remote backend (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Terraform Cloud).
- **Workspaces**: Managing multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and continuous deployment with GitHub Actions.
- **Automated Testing**: Integration of automated testing tools like `terraform validate` and `terraform plan`.

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure that the following software is installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version >= 1.x)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (On-prem, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) with appropriate credentials.

## Usage

### Running Terraform

```bash
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Environment Deployment Pipeline
**Scenario**: Efficiently manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) with minimal risk of configuration drift.

**Solution**: Utilize **Terraform workspaces** for environment isolation and **remote backends** (e.g., S3) for secure state management. Ensure consistency and scalability in deployments via **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD pipelines.

**Impact**: Streamlines deployment across environments, reducing human error and ensuring high-quality, reliable releases.

---

### 2. Automated Infrastructure Deployment and Scaling
**Scenario**: Automate infrastructure provisioning to support dynamic scaling and reduce manual intervention.

**Solution**: Leverage **Terraform modules** for reusable infrastructure components and integrate **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation. Automate resource creation and updates with minimal downtime.

**Impact**: Accelerates delivery, ensures repeatable infrastructure setups, and improves efficiency through automated, error-free provisioning.

---

### 3. Infrastructure Governance and Compliance
**Scenario**: Enforce compliance and governance policies across infrastructure deployments in regulated industries.

**Solution**: Use **remote backends** and **workspaces** to maintain versioned, auditable infrastructure. Integrate automated validation (e.g., `terraform validate`) and enforce **best practices** with code review workflows in **GitHub Actions**.

**Impact**: Ensures infrastructure meets compliance standards, reduces audit complexity, and minimizes the risk of non-compliance.

---

### 4. Cloud Cost Optimization
**Scenario**: Optimize cloud infrastructure costs by managing resources efficiently and scaling dynamically.

**Solution**: Implement **Terraform modules** for scalable, reusable infrastructure. Automate resource provisioning and scaling based on demand using **GitHub Actions** to trigger changes without over-provisioning.

**Impact**: Reduces cloud spend by eliminating underutilized resources and ensuring efficient, on-demand provisioning.

---

### 5. Disaster Recovery and Infrastructure Resilience
**Scenario**: Ensure rapid recovery and high availability of infrastructure in case of failure.

**Solution**: Store infrastructure state in **remote backends** for fast recovery and leverage **Terraform's IaC approach** for consistent, reproducible setups. Implement automated restoration using **CI/CD pipelines**.

**Impact**: Minimizes downtime, enhances system reliability, and accelerates disaster recovery processes, ensuring business continuity.
